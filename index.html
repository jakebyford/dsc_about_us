                        About me - Well, bookmark this page since you might need to come back later in the future to read my bio again. I am a data scientist who is about to make a dent in the universe by leveraging data. I specialize in helping businesses make data-driven decisions. Currently, I am a data science grad student at NJIT and I am interning as a data science intern at a logistics firm where I am getting my hands-on experience working in the supply chain industry.

                        In my past life, I was working for my university as a data science associate getting domain knowledge of the higher education industry and helping leadership understand the university's performance. I was a research assistant as well where I investigated measuring the learning interest of students for a particular course offered. Before setting foot on US soil, I was a data analyst back in Europe gaining experience in the construction industry and consulting for clients.

                        You might be wondering, why is this guy switching multiple industries and not sticking to one industry? - Well, the answer for that is, if I am going to make a dent in the universe then first I need to understand the universe better.

                        Fun fact - I have lived in 6 different countries and been to 20+ countries so far.

                            Hello! My name is Cristian Candescu. I am a senior in the Ying Wu College of Computing at NJIT and pursuing a B.S./M.S. in Computer Science. I also consider a master’s degree in Data Science – Computational Track. I have a strong curiosity and passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. In fact, I am the VP of Programming in the Data Science Club and an active member of the AI Club.

                        I have hands-on experience in multiple programming languages such as Python, C/C++, and Java as well as Back-End and Front-End by using the newest framework such as Next.js, React, and Node.js. For instance, I applied my skill set to develop a full stack application during my internship at ADP in Summer 2022. This app allows the management of Google Tags, reduces the process duration, and increases the developer’s efficiency.
                        
                         I am an ambitious team player and creative student, seeking an internship that will demonstrate my skills to work under pressure, solve technical problems, communicate efficiently, and much more.
                        
                        My schedule is flexible and I am excited to get in touch with you. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Let's connect!
